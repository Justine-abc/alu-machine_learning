B,D  # 1. High Bias, High Variance → try a different architecture, build a deeper network
B,D  # 2. High Bias, Low Variance → try a different architecture, build a deeper network
A,C,E  # 3. Low Bias, High Variance → train more, get more data, use regularization
F  # 4. Low Bias, Low Variance → nothing
